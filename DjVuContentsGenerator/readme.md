I created this generator because I wanted to automate creating Contents for DjVu files.
That moment I didn't know about this project http://handyoutlinerfo.sourceforge.net/
Anyway I want to improve my file, because it can be used inside LibreOffice with its advantages.

*System Requirements*
* LibreOffice 5 and later
It doesn't work in MC Excel, because marcoses are used. Of course, it is possible to port it into Excel, but I don't have time on it now.

*How to use*
Read inside file on the intro sheet.

*Feedback*
If you have any proposals or find bugs, please write to me https://github.com/Kovbas

*License*
Everyone either a person or an organisation can use it.
Please, keep a link to a source of the gererator.
No warranties.

*Plan*
1. add config processing.
2. add output to file.
3. try to add pdf TOC composing.
